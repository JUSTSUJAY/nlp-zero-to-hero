    "In this notebook, we saw how to convert **sequences of text** to **vectors of numbers** by using a basic **bag-of-words**, a process sometimes called **vectorization**.  Whilst this can be used for simple applications, it has a number of **limitations** including **losing word order information**. This can be partially resolved by using **n-grams** but it comes at the cost of **increasing** the size of our vocabulary. \n",
